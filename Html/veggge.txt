 you have decided to start the business but still asking the question, please do not do it. I assume you are interested in this so you wish to know about it to see if you can do it, then please continue reading.

Select a city and an area, fix a budget and stick to it.
If you do not have sufficient budget, go around and see what are the common veggies bought daily and what veggies are bought together.

Join hands or cut out a deal with the supplier. Remember the veggies are perishables so go for best deal and required quantity. Do not hope you might get a 50% more sale in a day. If you are expecting more sales then set your limit to 20% until you get a right figure.

Select a warehouse/store house, to store and pack the veggies for the day
Now you have your materials, let's set up a company.
5>
Register your firm with a good name. Buy a domain and build an ecommerce website.
Select an area in the city where you wish to start and start marketing. Both physical and online marketing. Give an option to call and order for those who are not aware of online shopping.
6>
Strategically move to the next area. Give a variety of delivery options like after 7pm so that once they are back from work they can receive their order.
Manage delivery. Since you are targeting a small area, you will find it easy and economical to manage them. Once you expand to other areas, you will already have the knowledge of maintaining them.
8>
Start monthly plans, and discounts for daily orders.
9>
Do not compromise on quality. Expand your inventory slowly.
10>
Ecommerce websites and carts are just a medium for the business. It will give you new customers but it cannot build a business, though it can give you one. All the best.

There goes the outline. If you need any specific answers, do comment.
